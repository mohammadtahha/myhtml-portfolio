<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an upcoming 18-year-old Web designer with a strong passion for technology and creativity. I studied computer science in secondary school, which helped me build a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. Since then, I’ve continued learning on my own, teaching myself web development and mastering JavaScript — something I’m really proud of because it shows my dedication and curiosity to keep improving.</p>

<p>Outside of coding, I’ve always loved playing football, which has taught me teamwork, focus, and discipline. I also enjoy watching anime and K-dramas — Link Click and One Piece are some of my favourites.</p>

<p>I think what makes me unique is how I balance both my technical and creative sides. I love challenging myself to grow as a developer while still finding inspiration in the things I enjoy — whether that’s through sports, shows, or exploring new ideas..</p>
